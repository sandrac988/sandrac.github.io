Besides spending my time doing homework set after set, I use my two clubs (Robotics and Racing Club) as outlets of relaxation as I contribute to practical designs. I especially appreciate all the great people I've met here as well as the strong collaborative culture that Caltech offers.</p>

My current interests include circuit and PCB design, but there are still so many other areas that I have not had the chance to get my hands dirty in and learn more about. I hope that as I continue to absorb valuable information from different experiences, I can build up a strong arsenal of skills that allow me to be a well rounded engineer. </p>

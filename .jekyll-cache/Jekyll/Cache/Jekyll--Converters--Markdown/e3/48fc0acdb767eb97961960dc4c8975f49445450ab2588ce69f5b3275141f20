 This is the hydrophone board that my partner and I fully designed in Altium. It is mounted onto the autonomous submarine designed by the Caltech Robotics Team. The Caltech Robotics Team participates in an annual competition where autonomous submarines execute a variety of tasks to as many points as possible. One of these tasks includes following pings generated by a pinger. This is where the hydrophone board comes into play. This board first amplifes and reduces noise from the received pinger signals. It then digitially processes them using methods involving sine and cosine tables as well as fourier integrals to compute the ping phase and direction to successfully move in the direction of the pinger. The next steps include implementing inter-submarine communication using a hydrophone transmitter board.
